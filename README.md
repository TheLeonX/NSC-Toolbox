# What got changed from Storm 4's Toolbox?
What if I will say - everything?
All tools were made from scratch with new design. I moved on from WinForms and switched to WPF.
This change will help us with some cool features which I might make in future.

# Exporting mods for mod manager
In this version of toolbox I made a tool, which will help you go through all stuff and make compatible mod very... VERY easily.
All you have to do is just make your mod with traditional ways (using tools and saving files in data_win32 folder) and when you done - just press on "Export Mod" button.

It doesn't need any special tutorial for that, it's pretty easy to understand how it works when you will try to export mod with it :)
